# 🐍 Number Guessing Game

A simple command-line game where the user tries to guess a secret number chosen by the computer. This was my first project built while learning the fundamentals of Python!

## 🎯 Features

* The computer generates a random number between 1 and 50.
* The user has a limited number of attempts (6) to guess the number.
* The game provides feedback ("Too high!" or "Too low!") after each guess.
* Handles invalid input if the user enters text instead of a number.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2.  Clone or download this repository.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4.  Run the game with the following command:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

This project was a great way to practice the following Python concepts:

* Variables and Data Types
* Using the `random` library
* `while` loops for game flow
* `if/elif/else` statements for conditional logic
* User input with `input()`
* Type conversion with `int()`
* Basic error handling with `try/except`
* Functions to organize code
